## About

This project was developed in-line with a user experience endevour for a university project (learn about the project at www.leonsportfolio.xyz). The project incorporates a database of books, which data is retrieved from when a user scans an NFC tag on the corresponding book. The application also includes a reviewing mechanism. Users can view reviews upon scanning a book, or write one their self; for others to see.

## Goal

The goal of the project was to include a more familiar mechanism to aid digital natives in selecting books in a physical book store.
